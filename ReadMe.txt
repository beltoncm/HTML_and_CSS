This is a readme file for the CSS HTML class. It is for Step 23


In this course I have created three web sites and began construction of a Portfolio webpage.ps

One of the website focused exclusively on animatin features of CSS.  In this website, I made use of the Hover over to essentially bounce the 

pointer.  I also used some CSS to obtain sizing. For example, I implemented a float feature so that all images would lay accross the screen and fit inside a container.

Another test website was a space traveal website.  Here my emphasis was function.  The structure supports viewing, as would be conducted during a 
visit for an online purchase, and features a contact form to use to reach the website administrator.  The website used extensive CSS to line up images and provide effects on hovering.


Recently, I edited a template for a portfolio page and included the redesigns needed to support an online portfolio in the form of a professional portfolio.
